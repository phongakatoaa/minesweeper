A basic Minesweeper clone made with C++

How to play:

1. Compile the minesweeper.cpp file

2. Enter coordinate of the tile you want to select (range 0-9)

3. Place a "F" at the end if you want to flag the tile, "N" if you don't. For example: 0 4 F to flag the tile at coordinate 0 4; 1 5 N to pick the tile at coordinate 1 5

Have fun with this small project, more features will be added later
